# My-Portfolio-Website

I have developed a responsive portfolio web application that showcases my education, list of projects, skills, contact information, recent blogs, and other relevant information. The website was created from scratch, and all components were developed by me.

- To ensure a visually appealing design, I used Figma mockups to implement UI-rich and pixel-perfect components. Additionally, I implemented animating elements using JavaScript and a third-party library called scrollreveal, which allowed for smooth and engaging transitions as users navigate through the site.

- To ensure the website is accessible on all devices, I utilized the Bootstrap grid system, flex classes, and CSS box model properties to implement responsiveness through a mobile-first approach.

- Furthermore, I implemented form validation and connected the form to Firebase to allow for the collection and storage of user data.

Technologies used for the development of the website include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React JS, Bootstrap, Figma, and Firebase.
